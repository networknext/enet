	Fix enet early out on client "fail to connect" in client... (may require making it delay again...)

	Turn on enet debug prints.

	Connect the client to the server.

	Make sure we don't spinlock inside enet_host_service

	To get network next client and server connecting, need to setup customer keypair and dev environment...

	Hook up packet send for client and server.

TODO

	Hook up packet receive for client and server.

	At this point, the client and server should be able to connect....

	------------

	Clean up:

		1. Fix up todos

		2. Pass in the network next data in host create

		3. Share with Erdogan :)
