	Fix enet early out on client "fail to connect" in client... (may require making it delay again...)

	Turn on enet debug prints.

	Connect the client to the server.

	Make sure we don't spinlock inside enet_host_service

	To get network next client and server connecting, need to setup customer keypair and dev environment...

	Hook up packet send for client and server.

TODO

	------------

	Hook up packet receive for server...

	Verify that response packet is sent back to client.

	Hook up packet receive for client...

	At this point, the client and server should be able to connect.

	------------

	Clean up:

		1. Fix up todos

		2. Pass in the network next data in host create

		3. Make sure no additional delay is added on packet receive due to ordering of calls (eg. don't get offset by one frame)

		4. Test with multiple clients connecting, to make sure no wires are crossed in server mux/demux of client packets.
