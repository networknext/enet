	
	Get enet building on macosx

	Get a test client/server example working on macosx with multiple clients connecting

	Add network next source to project.

	Setup premake to build network next.

	Build and link to network next library from client and server examples.

	Add next_sleep to client so we have a regular pump once per-second (ish).

	Client sends verifiable packets to enet server.

	Server validates packet data and responds with verifiable packet data.

	Client prints out when verified packets are received.

TODO

	Research and work out where to insert our packet send/receive.

	Gonna need to probably do it differently for the client and server.

	Or have some host mode, or whatever -- might be able to drive it from number of connections?
