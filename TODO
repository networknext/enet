	
	Get enet building on macosx

	Get a test client/server example working on macosx with multiple clients connecting

	Add network next source to project.

	Setup premake to build network next.

	Build and link to network next library from client and server examples.

	Add next_sleep to client so we have a regular pump once per-second (ish).

	Client sends verifiable packets to enet server.

	Server validates packet data and responds with verifiable packet data.

	Client prints out when verified packets are received.

	Research and work out where to insert our packet send/receive.

	Looks like surgery in enet_host.c is the right approach. Taking over the low-level socket implementation is bad news.

	Probably need to determine client via MaxConnections = 1, and host if MaxConnections >= 1 -- but this is a bit dodgey.

	There might be flags we can override...

TODO

	Dig in enet_host.c
