	Fix enet early out on client "fail to connect" in client... (may require making it delay again...)

	Turn on enet debug prints.

TODO

	Connect the client inside enet client connect to server fn... 

	------------

	Work out how to get the bind address and server address from enet (might need to be supplied...)

	Add the datacenter to the address.

	Is address pass in messages? Might be better to extend host create instead...

	Might be worthwhile passing in an enet_next_t struct to the host create. We have multiple parameters that need to get passed in.
